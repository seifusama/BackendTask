note : i had some help implementing this program from people with knowledge about classes because i have no prior knowledge of them

the program defines two classes (employee, book), their respective properties and methods

i couldn't implement the delete() method so it isnt included in the program

the main() acts as a menu to run the methods and output them to the user

but other than that the program is fully functional.
