the idea of the solution : there needs to be at least one character in the right place for the operation to be successful

this a solution for the short sort problem

the code starts by reading integer t, which acts as the number of test cases.

the while loop then iterates t times

inside the loop the string s is initialized and then by the user, which is then checked by the if statement to see if any of the letters are in the right place

if there is at least one, the operation is successful and "YES" is printed out

if there are no letters in the right place, the operation is not a success and "NO" is printed
